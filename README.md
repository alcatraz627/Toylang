## Toylang - A proof of concept to build an interpreter

Basic features like:
- [x] Declaring variables and updating them
- [ ] `for` and v`while` loops
- [ ] `if - else` statements
- [ ] Functions
- **Expression Evaluator** to recursively evaluate expressions with
  - [ ] Mathematical operations
  - [ ] Variables
  - [ ] Functions
- [ ] Error Handling

The idea is to build a very basic programming language
